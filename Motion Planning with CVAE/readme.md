The project discusses the implementation of CVAE to generate non-uniform samples to optimize the cost to goal.

Reference: https://github.com/StanfordASL/LearnedSamplingDistributions/tree/master

The code combines the CVAE work of Brian Itcher with additional robots such as 2D Omnidirectional and 4-link Kinematic Chain.
